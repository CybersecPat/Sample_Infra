# Sample_Infra
Sample Infrastructure Scripts that can be customized to stand up a test environment quickly. 

These scripts, Ansible playbooks, and Terraform plans can be used together to quickly stand up a malware analysis environment and a test domain controller.

As always you should make sure you're conducting testing in an isolated, non production environment. You should only use computers that you should assume are compromised. Do not use the same computer that you use personally or professionally to set these things up. It needs to be an isolated environment.
